BPDU filter

BPDU guard
when a port with PortFast receives a BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit), it realizes the device on the other end is a switch, not an end-host.

Default Action: The port loses its PortFast status and reverts to being a "normal" STP port.

The Risk: It will go through the standard Listening and Learning states. During this time, a temporary loop could still occur before STP converges.
